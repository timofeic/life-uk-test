Chapter 2 - What is the UK?
The UK is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
rest of Ireland is an independent country.

The official name of the country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. ‘Great Britain’ refers only to England, Scotland and Wales,
not to Northern Ireland. The words ‘Britain’, ‘British Isles’ or ‘British’,
however, are used in this book to refer to everyone in the UK.
There are also several islands which are closely linked with the UK but are
not part of it: the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. These have their own
governments and are called ‘Crown dependencies’. There are also several
British overseas territories in other parts of the world, such as St Helena and
the Falkland Islands. They are also linked to the UK but are not part of it.
The UK is governed by the parliament sitting in Westminster. Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland also have parliaments or assemblies of their
own, with devolved powers in defined areas.
